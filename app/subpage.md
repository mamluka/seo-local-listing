You must repay your loans even if you don’t complete your education, can’t find a job related to your program of study, or are unhappy with the education you paid for with your loan.  However, certain circumstances might lead to your loans being forgiven, canceled, or discharged.

## How Does Student Loan Forgiveness Work?

At the end of your consolidated loans term, any unpaid balance will be forgiven by the Department of Education. There are multiple repayment options available in the Obama Student Loan consolidation program. These provisions can allow for both early forgiveness or principal reduction on your consolidated loan.

## Teacher Loan Forgiveness

Teacher's who qualify for the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program probably benefit the most, out of all the loan forgiveness plans available. Teachers can qualify for both early forgiveness and principal reduction as well. $5,000 to $17,500 is offered in principal reduction on their loans under certain circumstances in the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program.  This encourages young graduates to pursue a career in teaching and also continue that career. After 10 years of repaying their loans, teachers can qualify for complete loan forgiveness.  Check with your HR department to see if you are eligible.

## Public Service Loan Forgiveness

Do you work a full time public service job? Workers in public service careers may qualify for public service loan forgiveness if they work full-time in a public service job.  Once you qualify, you would make 120 consecutive payments under certain repayment plans while still working full time in your public service position. Following those payments, the balance of your Federal Student Loan would be completely forgiven.

## Total and Permanent Disability Discharge

If a borrower is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of a mental or physical impairment, they may qualify for Total and Permanent Disability Discharge on their Federal Student Loan. Contact us for more information on total and permanent disability discharge.
